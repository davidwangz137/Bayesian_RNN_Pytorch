# Bayesian_RNN_Pytorch

This repository is my attempts to recreate the performance of various RNN improvments.

In the end I'm aiming to get [bayesian RNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.02798.pdf) and [recurrent highway networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03474) working, but first I want to reproduce the LSTM baselines on PTB without any tricks.
